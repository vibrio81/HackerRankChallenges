  A string containing only parentheses is balanced if the following is true: 
  1. if it is an empty string 
  2. if A and B are  correct, AB is correct, 
  3. if A is correct, (A) and {A} and [A] are also correct.

Examples of some correctly balanced strings are: "{}()", "[{()}]", "({()})"

Examples of some unbalanced strings are: "{}(", "({)}", "[[", "}{" etc.

Given a string, determine if it is balanced or not.
